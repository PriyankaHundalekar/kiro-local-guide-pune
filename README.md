1. **Rapid Prototyping** - Generated initial app structure and UI components
2. **Local Context Integration** - Helped design the cultural intelligence system
3. **Code Generation** - Automated creation of filtering and recommendation logic
4. **Documentation** - Assisted in creating comprehensive project documentation

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd local-event-discovery
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🎯 How It Works

The app uses a `product.md` file to understand local cultural nuances:
- Popular venues and their characteristics
- Neighborhood personalities and event types
- Local slang and cultural references
- Seasonal event patterns and preferences

This local intelligence powers smart recommendations and cultural insights throughout the user experience.
